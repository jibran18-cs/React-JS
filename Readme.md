1- npx create-react-app (This method is not recomended as it contains so many things which we don't even)

=> npm(it's a node package manager allows us to install some essetial libraries to work with)
++Sometimes we don't want to install a package we only directly want to execut it fot that purpose we use npx++
=> npx (node package executer)


## Important scripts

## npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
